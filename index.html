            <p>EduSolve would not be possible without the help of these gracious sponsors who are helping both the foundation and these ideas to grow and develop. We greatly appreciate any support given towards our cause and events as it sheds light upon the problem of unequal access of education. <span>Want to sponsor?</span> Contact us at: <span>apollofoundationus@gmail.com</span> and we can discuss about logistics, benefits and how you can help!</p>

            <p>Apollo Foundation is a non-profit organization, composed of passionate students and several well-achieved regional directors, that work to provide better and more enhanced education to underprivileged students around the world. Along with our dedicated volunteers, we have partnered with the Asante Africa Foundation, the Taleem Doo Foundation, and Area9 Lyceum to provide such education to impoverished students around the world. Furthermore, the Apollo Foundation has commenced various Initiatives, namely the India Initiative, Middle East Initiative, the Cameroon Initiative, and the East Africa Initiative. Within these, we help schools by forming projects to provide funds as well as curriculum-based tutorial videos and worksheets. Some of our big projects within these initiatives include the Roshni Project, in which we help underprivileged students in the Roshni Learning Center in Bihar, India, as well as helping impoverished schools in Cameroon.</p>
